Litemarket - v1.0 Unstable
==========
![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/username/projectname/branch/path/to/img.png)
-litecoind (also works with bitcoin).<br />
-currently uses 1 API (to grab litecoin prices every 6 hours).<br />
-calculates prices from fiat into LTC.<br />
-no javascript (trying to keep it css/HTML5 only).<br />


TODO
=========
-withdraw script.<br />
-fix messy code<br />
-look for potential exploits (main goal was to provide a stable release)<br />


Vendors/seller
=========
**WARNING**<br />
at launch the withdraw script will be in beta stage since: like if a customer sends litecoins with lots of inputs, this could bankrupt the site trying to withdraw it, raw transaction reports error if not enough fees, its a big risk but i want it 100% solved
