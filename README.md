TODO
=========
-withdraw script.<br />
-fix messy code<br />
-look for potential exploits (main goal was to provide a stable release)<br />


Vendors/seller
=========
**WARNING**<br />
at launch the withdraw script will be in beta stage since: like if a customer sends litecoins with lots of inputs, this could bankrupt the site trying to withdraw it, raw transaction reports error if not enough fees, its a big risk but i want it 100% solved<br />

FUTURE VERSION: (v1.3)
=========
I have a theory on new method to withdraw , need to rewrite the script though. ill probably be selling v1.3 if everything works + lifetime updates
