Its been a long time since i used this so the mysql dump has been lost sadly but it should be easy to make a new one
just get a notepad and write in it all the mysql query lines you found in all the php files.
then you will know the structure
you then just have to find the right data type for that column e.g int, text, varchar etc...


and if you could please send me the file. 


thank you
